module lec10 where

-- uncong' : {A B : Set}(f : A → B){a a' : A} → f a ≡ f a' → a ≡ a'

-- ℕ ≡ ⊤ → 0 ≡ 1

-- look at computing types, e.g. _^_, and prove some equations about it

-- ismonoid ℕ

-- alternative implementation of Vec?

Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician
would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the as-
tronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence
statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to
relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether.

-- there exists irrational numbers a b s.t. a^b is rational.
-- (sqrt(2))^(log_2 9) = sqrt(9) = 3

-- injectivity

-- negative translation
