0:45-0:55	task types in an exam:
     definitional equality (give two definitionally not equal objects with a given type)
     isomorphisms (I have to ask whether bijection is checked if there are no tests)
     		  strange things might be there, but sometimes there are shortcuts (e. g. a âŠ¤ -> A does not mean much more than an A)
     same with dependent types (but not too hard ones here, if you understand sigma and other basics)
     laws of logic (with dependent types too!)
     proofs for naturals
     negative proofs for naturals (with a counterexample; this can be a function or a relation too!)
     building simple relations (no proof, only definition)
     Fin and Vec (coming soon)
