t : A
t is a term (program), A is its type

We define a programming language by listing all the ways to construct
programs of different types and equalities which explain how programs
run.

1. Simple type theory rules, constructing programs with it

Booleans
Natural numbers
Product
Sum
Functions

2. Some propositional logic

Maybe talk about Curry-Howard?

3. Indexed types

Vectors
Equality

4. Predicate logic in full

do some discrete math
